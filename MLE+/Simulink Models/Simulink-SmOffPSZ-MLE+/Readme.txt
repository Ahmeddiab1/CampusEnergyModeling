This folder contains the complete source code for MLE+. You should be able to run SimpleSmOffPSZ.mdl from any 
Matlab distribution as long as running on a PC station (hasn't been tested in MAC, it might run though).

Requirements: 
- You would need to have E+ 8.0.0 installed. 
- You need to change the parameters in the Simulink file to agree with your configuration (Mask Parameters).

Files" 
- SimpleSmOffPSZ.mdl has the simulink model that controls two EnergyPlus Buildings. Both are the same buildings. 
- The E+ files are in SmOffPSZ1 and SmOffPSZ2 for building 1 and 2, respectively.
