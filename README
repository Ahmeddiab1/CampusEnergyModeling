Campus Energy Modeling
======================

NREL's Campus Energy Modeling project provides a suite of simulation tools for integrated, data
driven energy modeling of commercial buildings and campuses using Simulink. The tools enable
development of fully interconnected models for commercial campus energy infrastructure, including
electrical distribution systems, district heating and cooling, onsite generation (both renewable
and conventional), building loads, energy storage, and control systems.

Modeling Platform
-----------------

The Campus Energy Modeling library provides an interface between Simulink and several energy
modeling and data tools:

• SimPowerSystems [1] for electrical power systems
• EnergyPlus [2] (via MLE+ [3]) for building and thermal equipment models
• PVWatts [4] (via SSC [5]) for photovoltaic arrays
• Opal-RT [6] hardware using RT-LAB [7] for hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulation
• NREL's Databus [8] project for data acquisition (NREL internal use only)
