# Release Notes: v0.2

Release v0.2 includes a major rework of the electric vehicle (EV) models. The Simulink library now includes an [Electric Vehicles] section with five block models related to EVs. In addition, there are two new [demos] related to EVs:
* **EV Demand Management** - Demonstrates demand management using supervisory control of EV charging
* **EV PV Smoothing** - Demonstrates smoothing of photovoltaic array output using supervisory control of EV charging

For complete documentation, please see the [Campus Energy Modeling wiki].
