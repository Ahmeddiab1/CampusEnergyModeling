This is a RT-LAB simulation for 5 buildings (E+), 
a simple power network (SimPowerSystem), and HIL that displays the total
power consumption to an oscilloscope. 

Instructions: 
1. Take a Look at the MLE+ instructions included in the Library Folder. You need to set 
the dialog parameters for each MLE+ building. 

Features:
• This is setup to run on the RT-LAB machine but can also run properly in Simulink. 
• Multiple E+ building in Simulink. 
• Three Hospitals and two Secondary School buildings. 
• The aggregated power of the buildings is an input to the power network system. 
• You can control these plant knobs:
	i. Chilled Water Temperature. 
	ii. Chiller Plant Loop on/off control. 
• You can control these Weather knobs:
	i. Outside Dry Bulb Temperature.
	ii. Direct Solar Radiation. 
	iii. Diffuse Solar Radiation.
• You can output to the oscilloscope the aggregated power of the buildings.
