This is a demonstration of a customized constant power load block in SimPowerSystems (phasor mode). This block models a controllable constant power load, such as the energy consumption of a building. The block is also capable of operating with the source convention to model distributed generation.

Features:
•	Constant power load block for SimPowerSystems
•	Adjustable power knobs while the simulation is running

Requirements:
•	MATLAB/Simulink (R2013a)
•	Campus Modeling project MATLAB/Simulink libraries
•	SimPowerSystems

Instructions: 
1.	Run the model.
2.	Adjust the real and reactive power sliders up and down while the simulation runs.
3.	Stop the simulation and examine the results in the scope.
