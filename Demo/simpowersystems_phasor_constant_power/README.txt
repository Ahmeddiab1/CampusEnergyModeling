This is a demonstration of a customized constant power load block in SimPowerSystems (phasor mode). This block models a controllable constant power load, such as the energy consumption of a building. The block is also capable of operating with the source convention to model distributed generation.

Instructions: 
1. Run the model.
2. Adjust the real and reactive power sliders up and down while the simulation runs.
3. Stop the simulation and examine the results in the scope.

Features:
• Constant power load block for SimPowerSystems.
• Adjustable power knobs while the simulation is running.
