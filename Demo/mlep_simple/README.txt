This is a simple MLE+ example with a small office building. 
You can control the setpoints of the rooms. The outputs are 
set to change be the output temperature and room temperature. 

Instructions: 
1. Review the the MLE+ instructions included in the Library Folder.
2. Open MATLAB and set the working directory to the folder that contains this README file.
3. Open 'simpleSmOffPSZ.mdl' in Simulink.
4. Adjust the block mask parameters for the EnergyPlus Cosimulation block, if necessary.
5. Run the model and view the results on the scope.
