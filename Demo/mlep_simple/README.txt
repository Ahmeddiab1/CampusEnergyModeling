This is a simple MLE+ example with a small office building. You can control the setpoints of the rooms. The outputs are set to change the output temperature and room temperature. 

Features:
•	Single E+ building in Simulink via MLE+
•	Small Office Building with Temperature Setpoints (Heating and Cooling) as knobs

Requirements:
•	MATLAB/Simulink (R2013a)
•	Campus Modeling project MATLAB/Simulink libraries
•	EnergyPlus
•	MLE+

Instructions: 
1.	Review the the MLE+ instructions included in the Library Folder.
2.	Open MATLAB and set the working directory to the folder that contains this README file.
3.	Open 'simpleSmOffPSZ.mdl' in Simulink.
4.	Adjust the block mask parameters for the EnergyPlus Cosimulation block, if necessary.
5.	Run the model and view the results on the scope.
