This is a MLE+/Simulink simulation for 5 buildings (E+). 

Features: 
•	Multiple E+ building in Simulink via MLE+: three hospitals and two secondary school buildings
•	You can control the plant knobs:
	i.	Chilled Water Temperature
	ii.	Chiller Plant Loop on/off control
	
Requirements:
•	MATLAB/Simulink (R2013a)
•	Campus Modeling project MATLAB/Simulink libraries
•	EnergyPlus
•	MLE+
	
Instructions: 
1.	Review the the MLE+ instructions included in the Library Folder.
2.	Open MATLAB and set the working directory to the folder that contains this README file.
3.	Open 'runCampusSim.mdl' in Simulink.
4.	Adjust the block mask parameters for each EnergyPlus Cosimulation block, if necessary.
5.	Run the model and view the results on the scope.
