Building: 
Single floor rectangular building 100 ft x 50 ft. 5 zones - 4 exterior, 1 interior, zone height 
8 feet. Exterior zone depth is 12 feet. There is a 2 foot high return plenum: the overall 
building height is 10 feet. There are windows on all 4 facades; the south and north facades 
have glass doors.

The south facing glass is shaded by overhangs. The walls are woodshingle over plywood, R11 
insulation, and gypboard. The roof is a gravel built up roof with R-3 mineral board insulation 
and plywood sheathing.

The windows are of various single and double pane construction with 3mm and 6mm glass and 
either 6mm or 13mm argon or air gap.  The window to wall ratio is approxomately 0.29.

The south wall and door have overhangs.
The building is oriented 30 degrees east of north.

HVAC: 3 zone terminal reheat system using single constant volume air loop. Central chilled 
water coil scheduled to provide 16 C winter and 13 C summer supply air temperature. Terminal 
reheat coils trim supply air temperature to meet zone thermostat set point. Thermostat setting 
at 20 C in winter with 15 C set back temperature, 24 C in summer with 30 C set back 
temperature. Cooling coil off in winter, reheat coil on all year.

Zonal Equipment: AirTerminal:SingleDuct:ConstantVolume:Reheat
Central Air Handling Equipment: Yes
System Equipment Autosize:      No (chilled water, condenser, and hot water loop volumes are 
autosized)
Coils: Coil:Cooling:Water:DetailedGeometry
Pumps: Pump:VariableSpeed
Boilers: None
Chillers: Chiller:Electric, water cooled condenser (PlantEquipmentOperation:CoolingLoad set up 
for electric chiller only). Chiller:ConstantCOP or DistrictCooling may be used if desired in 
various combinations by changing priority control equipment list name in COOLING LOAD RANGE 
BASED OPERATION object.

Towers: CoolingTower:SingleSpeed (leaving water set point = Wet bulb, each towers UA = 175, 
water flow rate = 0.0011 m3/s, air flow rate = 8 m3/s, capacity is determined using UA and 
Design Water Flow Rate method)
