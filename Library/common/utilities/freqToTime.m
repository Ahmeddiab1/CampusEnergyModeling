%% Convert FD spectrum to TD waveform
% This function sythesizes a single period of a time-domain
% waveform given the supplied (one-sided) complex harmonic
% spectrum. The harmonic spectrum is assumed to be _sine_
% referenced (and is converted to cosine reference prior applying
% FFT). The first element of the spectrum corresponds to the DC
% component of the spectrum, the second element is the fundamental
% component corresponding to frequency 'f', and the subsequent
% elements correspond to harmonics of 'f'. The returned time series
% waveform is upsampled such that the sampling interval is at least
% as small as 'dt'. (It may be smaller if the specified 'dt' is too
% large to accomodate the harmonic content of the signal.)
%
% This function was originally developed by Stephen Frank at the National
% Renewable Energy Laboratory in connection with Project No. 192, under
% constract from the Bonneville Power Administration, Contract No. 51353 
% and Interagency Agreement No. IAG-11-1801. Permission has been granted to
% reuse this material in connection with Stephen Frank's dissertation
% research.
%
% SYNTAX:
%   [x t] = freqToTime(f, Y, dt)
%
% INPUTS:
%   f = Fundamental frequency
%   Y = Complex representation of harmonic spectrum
%       (sine referenced)
%   dt = desired maximum sampling interval of 'x'
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   x = data values of synthesized time domain waveform
%   t = time values of synthesized time domain waveform
%
% COMMENTS:
%   This function is the equivalent of performing the time domain
%   reconstruction documented in the timeToFreq() method.
%
%   Note also that the 't' vector returned has times running from 
%   t=0 to (T-dt). In other words, it represents exactly 1 period
%   worth of data, since time t=T represents the start of a second
%   period.
