%% constant_power.m - Test the Constant Power blocks
%
% This script tests the 'Constant Power Source or Load' and 'Three-Phase
% Constant Power Source or Load' blocks in the Campus Energy Modeling
% Simulink library. The tests verify that the measured power matches the
% target power within tolerance.
%
% FUNCTIONS:
%
% SIMULINK BLOCKS:
%   Constant Power Source or Load
%   Three-Phase Constant Power Source or Load
%
% TO DO:
%   1. Test the constant source case.
%   2. Test the low-voltage limit.

%% Setup
% Tolerance for PQ comparisons
tol = sqrt(eps);    % Approx 1.5e-8

%% Test Single-Phase Constant Power

% Open and run simulation

% Adjust model settings

    'StopTime',     '60'            );      % 1 minute

% Run simulation
